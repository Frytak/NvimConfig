# FNVIM

This is my own Neovim configuration, consisting of it's own theme, keymaps, LSP setups and some custom features. It's not suposed to be convinient for use to anyone else than me!

## Keymaps

## Theme

## TODO:
- Move keymaps into the corresponding plugin configurations
- Document the `directories` plugin
